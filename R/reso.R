#' reso: An esoteric R-based programming style
#'
#' Have you ever been frustrated at R, maybe after reading too many rude
#' Stackoverflow or R-help threads? (me too) Well, what if we took R and instead
#' of helping making it accessible and fun, made all of those esoteric,
#' jargon-y, incredibly annoying, and unreadable parts much worse?
#'
#' Enter \code{reso}, a library and R-package programming language. Only the
#' following symbols from R are allowed:
#'
#' c, (), [], !, 0, +, and "," (the comma).
#'
#' Along with four functions to make \code{reso} "go":
#'
#' s():
#' p():
#' x():
#' d(): an alias for \code{\link[base]{deparse}}
#'
#' More can be read about these in the \link{reso-native functions} page.
